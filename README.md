## Setting Up the Dev Environment
**NOTE:** Before proceeding with these instructions, make sure you have both [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
1. In the project directory, run the command `git clone https://github.com/Arpaesis/Zerra-Launcher.git`
1. In the new folder you just cloned, run the command ``npm install electron``.
1. After electron is installed, run the command ``npm install popper.js``.
1. After popper.js is installed, run the command ``npm install jquery``.
1. After jquery is installed, run the command ``npm install bootstrap``.
1. Now your dev environment is all set up. To run the launcher, run the command ``npm start``, and the launcher should run.
1. That's it! You're done. If at any single one of these steps you encountered an error, please contact Arpaesis#8924 on discord.
